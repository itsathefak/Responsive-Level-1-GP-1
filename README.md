# Responsive-Level-1-GP-1
For our group project, we created an e-commerce store called VibeVerse, an online haven for anime enthusiasts. The website offers a diverse collection of anime merchandise catering to fans of all genres. Each member of the group contributed to the design and development of at least one unique content page, with distinct layouts for each. The project followed responsive design practices, ensuring optimal usability across both desktop and mobile views. Features include responsive images, tables, forms, and consistent styling via external CSS
